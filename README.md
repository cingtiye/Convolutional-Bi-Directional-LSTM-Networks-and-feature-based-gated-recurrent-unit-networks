## Reproduce the models from paper 1 
- **Learning to Monitor Machine Health with Convolutional Bi-Directional LSTM Networks**
## and paper 2 
- **Machine health monitoring using local feature-based gated recurrent unit networks** 
### How to run?
Two model need install tensorflow-gpu (>=1.10.0) before you run. you can run two models by 

	python main_test.py
respectively in under two folders.

**if you want to learn more about two model details, you can write your questions or browse my blog. I just reproduce two papers, and i am not the author.**
